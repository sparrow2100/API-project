At age sixteen, she studied at the Royal College of Music in London under Ralph Vaughan Williams and Charles Wood. After the RCM, she continued her musical studies in Prague. Besides composing, Maconchy worked throughout her life to improve the lives of composers. She organised concerts in London in response to a lack of opportunities for female composers, and was also the Chair of the Composers Guild of Great Britain for many years (the first woman to hold that position), and President of the Society for the Promotion of New Music. She is considered to be one of the greatest composers of the British Isles. ",

Both her father and brother seem to have been tolerant but disapproving of her composition, as they didn’t think it was a fitting activity for a woman. However, Felix often wrote to his sister to ask for advice on his compositions, and later Fanny’s husband was supportive of her publishing her works. In her life Fanny composed over 450 works, mostly piano pieces and lieder. ",

She lived with her father following her parent’s divorce, and he trained her as a pianist. She was considered a prodigy,  beginning to tour Europe at the young age of eleven after her debut at age nine. Unfortunately, today she is perhaps most well known for her part in a ‘love triangle’ between herself, and famous composers Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms (Robert Schumann later becoming her husband). However, she was so admired at the time that among other honours she received a medal from Goethe, an offer from Niccolo Paganini to appear with her during a tour in Paris, enthusiastic praise from Franz Liszt, and a poem in her praise by Franz Grillparzer titled 'Clara Wieck and Beethoven'. After Robert’s death she continued to tour Europe for decades, and was appointed a teaching position at Dr. Hoch’s Konservatorium in Frankfurt, the only woman on the faculty. Despite her immense talent and the respect she commanded in the musical community, as she grew older and her other responsibilities grew, she became discouraged and is quoted as saying 'I once believed that I possessed a creative talent, but I have given up this idea; a woman must not desire to compose– there has never yet been one able to do it. Should I expect to be the one?'",
